## Neighbourhood Map Project

### App Description

This app lets you make notes of an life-forms you might spot
while out and about.

**To add a new entry:**

1. click the 'add' (+) button
2. drag the map marker to the desired location
3. enter a species name and click 'done' (tick)

The name should be entered in binomial form. If the name is
validated with Wikipedia it will then be added an some extra
information such as taxonomic classification, common names
and some general information will be added. A batch of the
latest related pictures from Flickr will be added too. To view
all of this, select the newly added marker.

TIP: Sometimes you may need to experiment with names, for
example '*Canis familiarus*' and '*Amphiprioninae*' will work
even though the accepted name for a dog is
'*Canis lupus familiaris*', and the fish is in monomial form.

**To browse and filter existing entries**

Click or touch the 'more' menu icon to pull out a 
filter list. Each species on the list may have one or
more sighting locations associated with it. You can filter
the list my using binnomial names, classifications (such as
'animal' or 'plant'), and common names.
